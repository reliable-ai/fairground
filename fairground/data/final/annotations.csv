adult,Adult,Adult,"This dataset was created as a resource to benchmark the performance of machine learning algorithms on socially relevant data. Each instance is a person who responded to the March 1994 US Current Population Survey, represented along demographic and socio-economic dimensions, with features describing their profession, education, age, sex, race, personal and financial condition. The dataset was extracted from the census database, preprocessed, and donated to UCI Machine Learning Repository in 1996 by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker. A binary variable encoding whether respondents' income is above $50,000 was chosen as the target of the prediction task associated with this resource.",,Adult; census,Silicon Graphics Inc,economics,income ,economics; demography,income; education; profession; sociology; hiring,tabular data,~50 K instances,1996,1994,"@inproceedings{kohavi1996scaling,

arrhythmia,Arrhythmia,Arrhythmia,"The first work referencing this dataset dates to 1997 and details a machine learning approach for the diagnosis of arrhythmia, which presumably motivated its collection. Each data point describes a different patient. Features include demographics, weight and height and clinical measurements from ECG signals, along with the diagnosis of a cardiologist into 16 different classes of arrhythmia (including none), which represents the target variable. A binary variable encoding the cardiolog's diagnosed presence or absence of cardiac arrhythmia can be chosen as the target of the prediction task associated with this resource.",The origin of the data for this set of patient records seems uncertain.,Arrhythmia,Bilkent University; Baskent University,cardiology,health; disease,cardiology,health; disease; heart disease; medicine,tabular data,~500  patients,1997,?,"@misc{guvenir1998arrhythmia,

drug,Drug,Drug,"This dataset was collected by Elaine Fehrman between March 2011 and March 2012 after receiving approval from relevant ethics boards from the University of Leicester. The goal of this dataset is to seek patterns connecting an individual’s risk of drug consumption with demographics and psychometric measurements of the Big Five personality traits (NEO-FFI-R), impulsivity (BIS-11), and sensation seeking (ImpSS). The study employed an online survey tool from Survey Gizmo to recruit participants world-wide; over 93% of the final usable sample reported living in an English-speaking country. Target variables summarize the consumption of 18 psychoactive substances on an ordinal scale ranging from never using the drug to using it over a decade ago, or in the last decade, year, month, week, or day. The 18 substances considered in the study are classified as central nervous system depressants, stimulants, or hallucinogens and comprise the following: alcohol, amphetamines, amyl nitrite, benzodiazepines, cannabis, chocolate, cocaine, caffeine, crack, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, legal highs, LSD, methadone, magic mushrooms, nicotine, and Volatile Substance Abuse (VSA), along with one fictitious drug (Semeron) introduced to identify over-claimers. A version of the dataset donated to the UCI Machine Learning Repository is associated with 18 prediction tasks, i.e., one per substance.","The 'sema' column (indicating fake drug usage) can be used to identify potential overclaimers; consider excluding these cases based on analysis goals.

The variables were reportedly constructed in a careful manner, taking into account laws that were in force at that time and following advice given by leading experts in that field. However, the variables also appear to be coded rather subjectively. For example, the variable _social condition_ admits as a value _Slightly problematic_, allegedly reserved for ""When education ability of parents is low (unequal, inconsistent education, exaggerated pretentiousness or indulgence, neurotic reactions of parents), or there are improper relations in family (easier forms of parental personality disturbances, privileged or ignored children, conflicts in the family)"".

Concerns about race-based disparities in this practice have been expressed multiple times, especially in connection with the subjective nature of ""reasonable suspicion"" and the fact that being in a ""high-crime area"" lawfully lowers the bar of what may constitute reasonable suspicion. The NYPD has a policy of keeping track of most stops, recording them in UF-250 forms which are maintained centrally and distributed by the NYPD. The form includes several information such as place and time of a stop, the duration of the stop and its outcome along with data on demographics and physical appearance of the suspect.
